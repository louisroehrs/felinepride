# Required Node.js Modules
The IGE server requires some node modules in order to run. From the ./ige/server/ folder, run this command:

	npm install

The module versions included in the install command are the latest versions that have been fully tested with the
engine build to date. Newer versions of the modules *may* work but it is not guaranteed and should you require
support for your project it will be assumed that you are running the recommended module versions.
