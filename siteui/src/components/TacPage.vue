  <h5 class="c4" id="h.7wkztixokcs7"><span class="c9 c0">PLEASE READ THIS TERMS OF SERVICE AGREEMENT</span></h5>
  <h5 class="c4" id="h.7wkztixokcs7-1"><span class="c0 c9">(&quot;TOS&quot; for short)</span></h5>
  <p class="c2"><span class="c1">The TOS tells you what you can and cannot do when you access or use Feline Pride. &ldquo;Feline Pride&rdquo; means felinepride.com, and all other Feline Pride-branded mobile apps and games. Feline Pride is owned and operated by LionHaus. (&ldquo;LionHaus&rdquo;, &ldquo;us&rdquo;, or &ldquo;we&rdquo;).</span></p>
  <p class="c2"><span class="c6">By using Feline Pride, you, and your parent/guardian (for themselves and on your behalf) agree to be bound by the TOS and our </span><span class="c6"><a class="c12" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.felinepride.com/privacy&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1525583681511000">Privacy Policy</a></span><span class="c1">. If you do not understand and agree to this TOS and our Privacy Policy, please do not use Feline Pride.</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c1">We have included some handy &ldquo;plain English&rdquo; translations below to help you better understand our terms, but if there is ever any question, it is only the full legalese version that covers your use of Feline Pride.</span></p>
<p class="c3"><span class="c0">1. Parental Consent.</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;If you want to play in Feline Pride or use our apps, you must be at least 18 years old or get permission from your parent or guardian. We require verifiable consent from a parent or guardian for players under 13 years old, which means we will take steps to make sure that your parent or legal guardian is really okay with you playing Feline Pride. When we get your parent or guardian&#39;s consent, we will also require he or she agrees to this TOS agreement. See our Privacy Policy for more on this.</span></p>
<p class="c3"><span class="c0">Translation: </span><span class="c1">Get your parent&rsquo;s permission before you use Feline Pride. Verified parental consent is REQUIRED for Feline Pride participation. Any accounts found operating without verified parental consent will be terminated.</span></p>
<p class="c3"><span class="c0">2. Community Guidelines.</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Don&rsquo;t post anything that is mean, foul, abusive, or obscene. This includes postings that contain profanity, are likely to offend someone, or that are racist, harassing, threatening, bullying or untrue. You also agree not to post things about other people that are false, illegal, or that may encourage someone else to break the law. Additionally, you may not create a screen name that we determine is inappropriate or offensive. Feline Pride is committed to providing a fair, clean, and fun environment for all. We use only professional, well-trained moderation staff and the most up-to-date technology to assist us in keeping Feline Pride safe and friendly.</span></p>
<p class="c3"><span class="c0">Translation: </span><span class="c1">Play nice, only use kind words, and don&rsquo;t engage in any unsafe or inappropriate gameplay or behavior.</span></p>
<p class="c3"><span class="c0">3. Report Misconduct.</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;If another player makes you feel bad or uncomfortable, you can use the buttons on that user&rsquo;s Player Card to block all further contact from them and report their behavior to the FPHQ support team. If you see someone breaking the rules, please report them to us with these in-game tools. We take these reports very seriously and investigate all of them as appropriate.</span></p>
<p class="c3"><span class="c0">Translation: </span><span class="c1">Report anything that makes you feel bad or that you think violates these rules. Block and report any player who bothers you by clicking or tapping their name and selecting Block Player on their Player Card.</span></p>
<p class="c3"><span class="c0">4. Keep Your Personal Information Personal. </span><span class="c1">Do not give out any of your Personal Information to other users of Feline Pride. Personal Information, which is described in detail in our Privacy Policy, includes real names, phone numbers, home addresses, user IDs, online profile names, e-mail addresses, photos, social networking site information, and location information.</span></p>
<p class="c3"><span class="c1">Never give other users any Financial Information (also described in our Privacy Policy), which includes usernames, passwords, financial account information, and Social Security numbers. Users found attempting to complete an unauthorized transaction on Feline Pride using someone else&rsquo;s financial information, regardless of payment method, will be permanently banned from Feline Pride. If a PayPal dispute or chargeback is initiated against any Feline Pride transaction, we will treat that charge as unauthorized and take necessary action.</span></p>
<p class="c3"><span class="c0">Translation: </span><span class="c1">Keep your personal information personal. Never give out (or ask for) real names or personal information while chatting with other Feline Pride players.</span></p>
<p class="c3"><span class="c0">5. Tell the Truth and Don&rsquo;t Cheat. </span><span class="c1">You agree to provide us with information that is true, complete, up-to-date, and accurate. If you break this promise, we may immediately cancel your membership. You must keep your account information secret, and you agree to notify us immediately if you think someone has used your membership without your authorization.</span></p>
<p class="c3"><span class="c1">Never attempt to use third-party websites, hacking programs, cheat codes, or related methods to hack or circumvent Feline Pride systems or policies. NONE OF THESE METHODS ACTUALLY WORK. They are created by criminals to steal your personal information, infect your computer with malware, or to lure you into visiting illicit online marketing sites. You may not attempt to send viruses, keyloggers, or trojans to Feline Pride, LionHaus employees, or other users. Never attempt to alter Feline Pride or our server technology or coding to your advantage. Attempts to defraud other players or take their in-game items by gaining their trust (i.e. &quot;scamming&quot;) are absolutely not tolerated and will result immediately in the loss of access to Feline Pride. This includes attempts to trade Feline Pride virtual items outside of our in-game trading system, asking users to share or trade account login information, or any other tricks to cheat other players in the game.</span></p>
<p class="c3"><span class="c0">Translation: </span><span class="c1">Make sure all of the contact information you send us is accurate. Don&rsquo;t try to cheat other Feline Pride players, and don&rsquo;t try to cheat us. Scamming players for items or not being honest in a trade will get you banned from the game. Websites offering free codes, Gems, or Feline Pride items are scams and do not work. We can tell if you try to use external software to cheat in the game, and we ban those accounts that attempt it.</span></p>
<p class="c3"><span class="c0">6. Respect the Ownership Rights of Others (DMCA). </span><span class="c1">You represent and warrant that you own or have the necessary licenses, rights, consents, and permissions to use, and authorize us to use, all content shared by you on Feline Pride. If you do not have proper license to share, then please do not post it to Feline Pride.</span></p>
<p class="c3"><span class="c1">If you are a copyright owner and believe that any content infringes upon your copyrights, you may submit a notification pursuant to the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (&quot;DMCA&quot;) by providing our Copyright Agent with: a) A physical or electronic signature of a person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed; b) Identification of the copyrighted work claimed to have been infringed, or, if multiple copyrighted works at a single online site are covered by a single notification, a representative list of such works at that site; c) Identification of the material that is claimed to be infringing or to be the subject of infringing activity and that is to be removed or access to which is to be disabled and information reasonably sufficient to permit the service provider to locate the material, including the steps required to access it in the game; d) Information reasonably sufficient to permit the service provider to contact you, such as an address, telephone number, and e-mail address; e) A statement that you have a good faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law; and f) A statement that the information in the notification is accurate, and under penalty of perjury, that you are authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.</span></p>
<p class="c3"><span class="c1">Our designated Copyright Agent to receive notifications of claimed infringement is Hughes Media Law Group PLLC, email: copyright@LionHaus.com, fax: 206-260-9300. You acknowledge that if you fail to comply with all of the requirements of this Section 6, your DMCA notice may not be valid.</span></p>
<p class="c3"><span class="c0">Translation: </span><span class="c1">Don&rsquo;t post any content on Feline Pride that you don&rsquo;t own. If you find something on Feline Pride that belongs to you and was put up without your permission, please contact us using the copyright infringement notice process described here.</span></p>
<p class="c3"><span class="c0">7. Content Posted by Users.</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;We do not promise that information on Feline Pride posted by third parties, including content posted by other users, is accurate or reliable. While we diligently monitor and screen postings to keep Feline Pride suitable for kids, we make no warranties, express or implied, as to the accuracy, reliability, or suitability of any postings. We have no obligation to modify or remove any inappropriate postings, and no responsibility for the conduct of the member submitting any posting. Notwithstanding the foregoing, we, in our sole discretion, reserve the right to prevent any postings from being placed on Feline Pride, and to edit, restrict, or remove such postings for any reason at any time.</span></p>
<p class="c3"><span class="c0">Translation: </span><span class="c1">We work hard to make Feline Pride a safe place for kids, but a lot depends on our players. LionHaus is not responsible for content on Feline Pride posted by users or other third parties. However, if we think content is not appropriate, we can take it down at any time without asking for permission.</span></p>
<p class="c3"><span class="c0">8. No Hacking. &nbsp;</span><span class="c1">You agree not to post any content that contains viruses, corrupted files, or any other similar software or programs that may harm Feline Pride or make it operate poorly, or that would do the same to a third-party computer or any other specific feature of Feline Pride. You also agree that you will not decompile, disassemble or copy Feline Pride or any of its source code or network transmissions. If you violate this rule we will remove you as a user and block you from using Feline Pride. Doing so, however, does not limit our other rights and remedies. Also, you understand that by breaking this rule, you will have irreparably harmed us and Feline Pride.</span></p>
<p class="c3"><span class="c0">Translation: </span><span class="c1">Don&rsquo;t ruin it for everyone else by trying to hack, copy or reverse engineer all or part of Feline Pride. Also, don&rsquo;t share viruses, or corrupted links or files with Feline Pride or Feline Pride users.</span></p>
<p class="c3"><span class="c0">9. Termination. &nbsp;</span><span class="c1">We may, in our sole discretion and with or without warning, cease operation of Feline Pride, terminate your membership to Feline Pride, or otherwise restrict your access to Feline Pride. Furthermore, should we find any user breaking our rules, we reserve the right to suspend or delete associated accounts and take any other action we deem appropriate.</span></p>
<p class="c3"><span class="c0">Translation: </span><span class="c1">We can suspend or terminate your Feline Pride account and the game itself at any time, with or without any notice to you.</span></p>
<p class="c3"><span class="c0">10. License to Use Feline Pride. </span><span class="c1">We grant you the non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable, limited right and license to access Feline Pride for personal, non-commercial use. Your rights are subject to your compliance with this TOS agreement. The term of your license starts on the date that you install or otherwise use Feline Pride, and ends on the earlier of you ceasing use of Feline Pride or our terminating your license. Your license terminates immediately if you violate the law or attempt to circumvent any technical protection measures used in connection with Feline Pride.</span></p>
<p class="c3"><span class="c1">We retain all right, title and interest to Feline Pride, including, but not limited to, all copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, trade names, proprietary rights, patents, titles, computer codes, audiovisual effects, themes, characters, character names, stories, dialog, settings, artwork, sound effects, musical works, and moral rights whether registered or not, and all applications thereof.</span></p>
<p class="c3"><span class="c1">Feline Pride is protected by applicable laws and treaties throughout the world. Unless expressly authorized by mandatory legislation, Feline Pride may not be copied, reproduced or distributed in any manner or medium, in whole or in part, without our prior written consent. All rights not expressly granted to you herein are reserved by us.</span></p>
<p class="c3"><span class="c0">Translation: </span><span class="c6">LionHaus</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;owns all aspects of Feline Pride, and your use of Feline Pride does not give you any ownership rights. You have our permission to use Feline Pride as long as you comply with the TOS and our Privacy Policy.</span></p>
<p class="c3"><span class="c0">11. License to Use Feline Pride Content. &nbsp;</span><span class="c1">The information, pictures, graphics, games, and updates for use in Feline Pride (e.g., new levels, missions, characters, and in-game items and in-game currency, such as gems, diamonds, etc.) (&quot;Game Items&quot;), and other content, features and services available in Feline Pride, including content posted by users (collectively, the &quot;Feline Pride Content&quot;) are owned by us or our suppliers or licensors and are protected by copyright and other laws throughout the world. We grant you a non-exclusive license to reproduce portions of the Feline Pride Content for the sole purpose of reviewing and using the Feline Pride Content as permitted in this TOS. We may require you to pay a fee for a non-exclusive license to use certain Feline Pride Content. You acknowledge that Feline Pride Content has no real world value, is licensed as part of, and may only be used in, Feline Pride. Accordingly, you may not sell or transfer the Feline Pride Content (including your account access information) and all such transfers or sales are null and void. All copyright and other proprietary notices on any Feline Pride Content must be retained on any copies. Any unauthorized reproduction or modification, distribution, or performance of any Feline Pride Content is strictly prohibited.</span></p>
<p class="c3"><span class="c1">You will not to copy, reproduce, republish, upload, display, post, or transmit any Feline Pride Content, and will not make or distribute things where you include the Feline Pride Content. It is a violation of our rights to do this, even if you are not selling the items, but are only giving them away. The only time you can do this is if we specifically give you permission. The use of Feline Pride Content for any other purpose is a violation of our copyright and other proprietary rights.</span></p>
<p class="c3"><span class="c0">Translation: </span><span class="c1">The virtual items that you purchase, create, or acquire in Feline Pride -- including memberships, avatar accessories, den items, and in-game currency -- are not property owned by you. As a result, you do not have the right to modify, share, transfer or sell this stuff.</span></p>
<p class="c3"><span class="c0">12. Refunds. &nbsp;</span><span class="c1">We want everyone to be completely satisfied with our products, so we have developed the following refund rules to avoid any surprises. Refunds are granted at our sole discretion.</span></p>
<p class="c3"><span class="c0">12.1 Recurring Transactions. </span><span class="c1">As a convenience for our premium club members, some membership subscriptions automatically renew at the end of the membership term, unless the recurring/renewal feature of the membership is cancelled. Recurring membership plans are clearly labeled as such in the Feline Pride purchase interface. Parents can cancel automatic membership renewal at any time by logging into their Parent Account and using their account controls. You will not be charged for any further renewal fees if you cancel a recurring membership.</span></p>
<p class="c3"><span class="c0">12.2 Customer Satisfaction.</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;If notice of cancellation is received within 7 days of the initial purchase date, you will be eligible for a full refund. No refunds will be granted AFTER 7 DAYS from the date of purchase (except as described below for duplicate and unauthorized charges.) If a membership package has automatically renewed, you also have up to 7 days to request a refund. No refunds will be granted for renewal charges AFTER 7 DAYS.</span></p>
<p class="c3"><span class="c0">12.3 Retail Gift Cards. </span><span class="c1">All gift card redemptions are final. NO refunds will be given. Information regarding gift card issue resolution can be found on the gift card itself or at the store where it was purchased.</span></p>
<p class="c3"><span class="c0">12.4 FP Outfitters Online Gift Certificates. </span><span class="c6">All gift certificate redemptions are final. NO refunds will be given. Additionally, we do not offer refunds on Gift Certificates bought through our </span><span class="c6">FP</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Outfitters website.</span></p>
<p class="c3"><span class="c0">12.5 Banned Accounts. </span><span class="c1">Club member accounts that have received a permanent account ban for violating the Feline Pride rules will NOT be eligible for any refunds.</span></p>
<p class="c3"><span class="c0">12.6 Unauthorized Purchase. </span><span class="c1">If notice of cancellation is received within the first 30 days of purchase and the account has been accessed (logged into) fewer than three times, you will be eligible for a refund. If more than four play sessions have occurred or notice is received after 30 days of purchase, you will not be eligible for a refund. The unauthorized purchase policy only applies to initial purchases (not any automatic renewal charges).</span></p>
<p class="c3"><span class="c0">12.7 Duplicate Orders. </span><span class="c1">If you have inadvertently placed duplicate orders, please contact customer support. You will be eligible for a refund of the duplicate charge(s) within 45 days of the purchase date. After 45 days, you will not be eligible for a refund of any duplicate charges.</span></p>
<p class="c3"><span class="c0">12.8 Membership Transfer. </span><span class="c1">Memberships cannot be transferred from one player account to another. If a membership was purchased for the wrong account, you will need to cancel the existing membership and purchase club membership for the correct player account.</span></p>
<p class="c3"><span class="c0">12.9 Other Fees. </span><span class="c1">You are solely responsible for any and all fees charged by your payment method provider, including your payment card issuer, bank, or financial institution; charges which may include, but are not limited to, membership, overdraft, insufficient funds and over-the-credit-limit fees.</span></p>
<p class="c3"><span class="c0">12.10 Additional Information. </span><span class="c1">Refunds can only be issued to your original form of payment. Refunds cannot be issued to a different credit card or via a different payment method. If the credit card used for the purchase has been cancelled or has expired, we cannot issue a refund for that transaction.</span></p>
<p class="c3"><span class="c0">Translation: </span><span class="c1">Here are our refund policies. They&rsquo;re pretty straightforward but there&rsquo;s a lot of information, so just read what&rsquo;s above.</span></p>
<p class="c3"><span class="c0">13. Data Storage in the U.S. and Export of Feline Pride Software. &nbsp;</span><span class="c6">LionHaus</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;is based in the United States, and we make no representation that Feline Pride is appropriate or available for use in other countries. Those who choose to access Feline Pride from other locations do so on their own initiative and are responsible for compliance with local laws, if and to the extent local laws are applicable, and understand that information they provide to us will be sent out of their home country to the United States. Furthermore, the United States government places controls on exporting downloadable software into certain countries listed on the Office of Foreign Asset Control Sanction List. If you are in such a sanctioned country, or your name appears on the U.S.&rsquo;s Specially Designated Nationals or Table of Deny Orders, then you may not download or use Feline Pride software.</span></p>
<p class="c3"><span class="c0">Translation: </span><span class="c6">Feline Pride</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;is made for use in the United States. LionHaus makes no promises about whether Feline Pride is appropriate for use outside of the United States.</span></p>
<p class="c3"><span class="c0">14. Feedback. </span><span class="c1">We are grateful for any ideas or feedback you provide to us about our products, but we need to maintain our rights to our intellectual property. Accordingly, please do not send us any original creative materials such as stories, character or program ideas or original artwork, unless we have specifically requested that you do so. Any unsolicited submissions received by us will be deemed our property. To the extent any part of your submission is deemed not to be owned by us, then you, and your parents or guardians if you are under 18, agree to assign to us any right, title and interest in and to the submissions and waive any &quot;moral rights&quot; you may have in the submission.</span></p>
<p class="c3"><span class="c0">Translation: </span><span class="c1">We love hearing your ideas about our games, but before you send us anything, you must understand and agree that any ideas or concepts you voluntarily share with us become our property.</span></p>
<p class="c3"><span class="c0">15. REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES AND LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITIES. </span><span class="c1">WE MAKE NO REPRESENTATION, WARRANTY, AND/OR GUARANTEE OF THE SUITABILITY OF FELINE PRIDE FOR YOUR PURPOSES, OR THAT THE USE OF THE SAME WILL BE SECURE, UNINTERRUPTED, ERROR-FREE, FREE OF VIRUSES OR OTHER HARMFUL COMPONENTS, OR FUNCTION PROPERLY IN COMBINATION WITH ANY THIRD-PARTY TECHNOLOGY, HARDWARE, SOFTWARE, SYSTEMS OR DATA.</span></p>
<p class="c3"><span class="c1">FELINE PRIDE IS PROVIDED &ldquo;AS IS&quot; AND ALL CONDITIONS, REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES, WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION ANY IMPLIED WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY, TITLE, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OR NON-INFRINGEMENT ARE HEREBY DISCLAIMED TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. FURTHER, WE MAKE NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, AS TO THE OPERATION OF THE SAME, OR TO THE INFORMATION, CONTENT, COMMUNICATIONS, MATERIALS, OR PRODUCTS AND SERVICE CONTAINED THEREIN.</span></p>

<p class="c3"><span class="c1">WE WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGES OF ANY KIND ARISING FROM YOUR USE OF FELINE PRIDE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, PUNITIVE AND CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES. CERTAIN STATE LAWS DO NOT ALLOW LIMITATIONS ON IMPLIED WARRANTIES OR THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF CERTAIN DAMAGES. IF THESE LAWS APPLY TO YOU, SOME OR ALL OF THE ABOVE DISCLAIMERS, EXCLUSIONS, OR LIMITATIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU, AND YOU MAY HAVE ADDITIONAL RIGHTS.</span></p>
<p class="c3"><span class="c1">IN NO EVENT SHALL OUR TOTAL LIABILITY TO YOU FOR ALL DAMAGES, LOSSES, CLAIMS AND CAUSES OF ACTION INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, IN CONTRACT, TORT, NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE, EXCEED A TOTAL OF FIVE DOLLARS ($5.00). THIS LIMITATION APPLIES TO ALL CAUSES OF ACTION OR CLAIMS IN THE AGGREGATE FOR ANY REASON. APPLICABLE LAW MAY NOT ALLOW THE LIMITATION OR EXCLUSION OF LIABILITY OR INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THE ABOVE LIMITATION OR EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. THE PROVISIONS OF THIS SECTION DO NOT WAIVE OR LIMIT OUR ABILITY TO OBTAIN INJUNCTIVE OR OTHER EQUITABLE RELIEF FOR BREACH OF THIS AGREEMENT.</span></p>
<p class="c3"><span class="c0">Translation: </span><span class="c1">WE AREN&rsquo;T PROMISING THAT FELINE PRIDE WILL WORK PROPERLY OR THE WAY YOU WANT IT TO. USE FELINE PRIDE AT YOUR OWN RISK. WE ARE NOT LIABLE IF YOU SUFFER ANY HARM THROUGH YOUR USE OF FELINE PRIDE. THERE ARE MANY LIMITATIONS ON OUR LIABILITY IN THIS PART, SO WE PUT EVERYTHING IN CAPS TO SHOW YOU HOW IMPORTANT IT IS. EVEN THOUGH THERE&rsquo;S PLENTY OF OTHER IMPORTANT STUFF IN THIS AGREEMENT AND WE DIDN&rsquo;T PUT THE WHOLE THING IN CAPS. MAYBE WE SHOULD. WE&rsquo;LL TALK ABOUT IT AND LET YOU KNOW.</span></p>
<p class="c3"><span class="c0">16. Indemnification. &nbsp;</span><span class="c1">You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold us, our parent and affiliated companies, and all officers, directors, owners, agents, information providers, affiliates, licensors, and licensees harmless from and against any and all claims, costs, damages, losses, liabilities and expenses (including attorneys&#39; fees and costs) arising out of or in connection with your use of Feline Pride, Feline Pride Content, as well as your breach of this TOS. You shall use best efforts to cooperate with us in the defense of any claim. We reserve the right, at our own expense, to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter otherwise subject to indemnification by you.</span></p>
<p class="c3"><span class="c0">Translation: </span><span class="c1">If you use Feline Pride and something bad happens because of it, neither LionHaus nor anyone affiliated with us will be held responsible.</span></p>
<p class="c3"><span class="c0">17. Choice of Law and Dispute Resolution. &nbsp;</span><span class="c1">You agree that: (a) Feline Pride is solely based in Utah, USA; and (b) Feline Pride&rsquo;s availability in other locations shall not give rise to personal jurisdiction over us, either specific or general, in jurisdictions other than Utah. The TOS shall be governed by the internal substantive laws of the State of Utah, without regard to its conflict of laws principles. Any claim or dispute between you and us that arises in whole or in part from Feline Pride shall be decided exclusively by arbitration taking place in person in Salt Lake City, Utah pursuant to the commercial arbitration rules then in effect of the American Arbitration Association; provided that said rules shall be modified as follows: (a) a party seeking arbitration shall notify the other party in writing of any claim, and provide sufficient detail about the nature and history of such claim together with sufficient documentary evidence of such claim; (b) there shall be only one arbitrator with sufficient knowledge and experience in the field of intellectual property and software development, which shall be chosen by an independent third party mutually acceptable to both parties; (c) the arbitrator shall reasonably mitigate all costs of the arbitration, and shall at all times attempt to avoid undue costs and expenses to the parties; (d) the arbitration in its entirety (including discovery, preparation, hearings, motions, etc.) shall not exceed a total of fifty (50) hours total, and shall begin and conclude within one hundred and eighty (180) days of the date the party seeking arbitration of a claim provides notice of such claim; (e) the parties may discover each other&rsquo;s documents in accordance with the Utah Rules of Civil Procedure, provided such discovery is limited by the arbitrator in a manner to comply with the time and budget constraints set forth in subsection (d) and (e); and (f) the prevailing party in any arbitration brought under the TOS shall be entitled to recover from the other party its reasonable attorney&rsquo;s fees and related costs of the arbitration, which fees and costs shall be included in and become part of the arbitration award.

<p class="c3"><span class="c0">Translation: </span><span class="c1">If there is a dispute between you and LionHaus and it can&rsquo;t be resolved through direct conversations, you agree that it will be resolved by arbitration taking place in Salt Lake City, Utah and following the specific rules set out above.</span></p>
<p class="c3"><span class="c0">18. Links to Third Parties. </span><span class="c1">As a service to you, we may provide links from Feline Pride to websites of third parties. Once you leave Feline Pride, we have no control over third parties and their respective websites, the content of those websites, or their terms of service. The same applies to links to third-party sites from other players.</span></p>
<p class="c3"><span class="c0">Translation: </span><span class="c6">LionHaus</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;is not responsible for anything that might happen once you leave Feline Pride, even if your leaving Feline Pride was because of a link on Feline Pride.</span></p>
<p class="c3"><span class="c0">19. Updates to the TOS. &nbsp;</span><span class="c1">From time to time and in our sole discretion, may modify the TOS. If we update the TOS, we will let you know by emailing you (if we have your email address), or by posting an announcement on Feline Pride. Your continued use of Feline Pride will indicate your consent to the revised TOS.</span></p>
<p class="c3"><span class="c0">Translation: </span><span class="c1">We update the TOS sometimes. When we do, we will put up a notice or email you about the changes.</span></p>
<p class="c3"><span class="c0">20. Miscellaneous. </span><span class="c1">The TOS and Privacy Policy constitute the complete and final agreement between the parties (and your parent/guardian if you are a minor.) If any provision of the TOS is unenforceable for any reason, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable and such decision shall not affect the enforceability of that provision under other circumstances, or of the remaining provisions under all circumstances. The parties are independent contractors, no joint venture, partnership, employment, agency or exclusive relationship exists. Our failure to enforce any right or provision in this TOS shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. We may transfer or assign this TOS or Feline Pride, in whole or in part, to any third party of our choosing. The TOS shall inure to the benefit of and be binding upon either party&rsquo;s respective successors and permitted assigns.</span></p>
<p class="c3"><span class="c0">Translation: </span><span class="c1">This TOS is the only agreement between us. If we decide not to enforce part of it in certain situations, that doesn&rsquo;t mean the rules have changed. You and LionHaus are independent contractors. We can transfer the rights and obligations of the TOS but you cannot. The TOS will still be binding on anybody who takes over LionHaus or takes over your life.</span></p>
